      <p>Barber uses some the newest features that were developed in Ghost 1.0. The theme by default comes with tag pages sorted by most frequently used ones, a subscription form to build your newsletter mailing list, a contact form for visitors to reach out to you, and Google AMP pages so your blog has an increased mobile ranking.</p>
